### Duration:
The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM (UTC) on February 15, 2024.
### Impact: The web application's authentication service was down, causing login failures for 30% of users.
## Timeline:

### Detection:
The issue was detected at 10:00 AM through automated monitoring alerts.
### Actions Taken: Investigation focused on the authentication server; assumptions were made about database connectivity issues.
Misleading Paths: Initially, engineers explored potential DDoS attacks, diverting efforts from the actual root cause.
### Escalation: 
The incident was escalated to the DevOps and Database teams.
### Resolution: 
The issue was resolved by restoring a misconfigured database connection string at 2:00 PM.
## Root Cause and Resolution:

### Cause: 
A recent deployment introduced an error in the database connection string, disrupting authentication.
### Resolution: 
The correct database connection string was applied, restoring normal service functionality.
## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

### Improvements/Fixes:
Enhance deployment testing to catch configuration errors.
Implement automated checks for critical configuration parameters.
### Tasks:
Conduct a post-deployment checklist to verify configuration accuracy.
Update monitoring to detect similar issues promptly.


This incident underscores the importance of rigorous testing and monitoring in our deployment process. Moving forward, we commit to strengthening our pre and post-deployment procedures to prevent configuration-related outages.
